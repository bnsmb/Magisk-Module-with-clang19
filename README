This Magisk module contains clang19, GNU make 4.4.1, pkg-config 0.29, pkgconf 2.3.0 and the files necessary from the Android NDK r27b for arm64 CPUs


The clang19 files are in the directory 

/system/usr/clang19


The clang19, make, pkg-config, and pkgconf binaries are in the directory

/system/usr/clang19/bin


The files from the NDK are in the directory

/system/usr/ndk/r27b

The sysroot from the NDK is in the directory

/system/usr/ndk/r27b/sysroot


Use the command

source /system/bin/init_clang19_env

to init the environment for the clang19. This scripts defines all necessary environment variables (including the PATH variable) to use the clang.


The script init_clang19_env executes the script 

/data/local/tmp/local_init_clang19_env

if it exists (use the parameter "no_user" to disable the execution of this script)



To use pkgconf instead of pkg-config set the variable PKG_CONFIG:

export PKG_CONFIG=/system/usr/clang19/bin/pkgconf



Use the command

/system/bin/init_clang19_env help

to print the usage help for the init script



Source Code used to create the binaries
---------------------------------------

The repo with the source code for the clang is:

https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project

The source code was checked out in 10/2024

See the file 

source/myconfigure 

in the Magisk Module for the cmake options used to prepare the build process for the clang19.
The clang19 binaries were compiled on a machine running the Linux OS withi the Cross Compiler from the Android NDK r27b
